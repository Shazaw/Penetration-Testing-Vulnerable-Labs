## Hard Lab - Vulnerability Risk Ratings

This document provides a CVSS v3.1 risk rating for the vulnerabilities in this lab.

### 1. File Upload with Content-Type Bypass

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **7.5 (High)**
* **Justification:** Requires an authenticated session (Low Privileges) and is more complex (High Complexity) because it requires a proxy like Burp Suite to bypass the filter. Success provides a web shell, leading to high impact.

### 2. Command Injection in Network Tool

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **8.8 (High)**
* **Justification:** Requires an authenticated session (Low Privileges) but is easy to exploit (Low Complexity) with a simple command separator. It directly provides a reverse shell, leading to full compromise of the web server user.

### 3. Privilege Escalation via Writable Cron Job

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **7.8 (High)**
* **Justification:** A local attack requiring an existing shell. The exploit is trivial (overwrite a file and wait), and success results in a full `root` compromise.
