## Tomcat Manager Exploit Walkthrough

1.  **Enumeration:** A port scan reveals that port 8080 is open and running Apache Tomcat.
2.  **Brute-Force:** Use a tool like Hydra to brute-force the login for the Tomcat Manager application at `/manager/html`. Using a common wordlist, the credentials `tomcat:s3cret` can be found.
    ```bash
    hydra -l tomcat -P /path/to/wordlists/legacy-passwords.txt <TARGET_IP> -s 8080 http-get /manager/html
    ```
3.  **Exploitation:** Use Metasploit's `exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy` module with the found credentials to upload a malicious WAR file and gain a reverse shell.
4.  **Post-Exploitation:** The flag can be found at `/var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/manager/flag.txt`.
