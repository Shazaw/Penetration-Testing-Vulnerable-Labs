## Medium Lab - Vulnerability Risk Ratings

This document provides a CVSS v3.1 risk rating for the vulnerabilities in this lab.

### 1. SQL Injection on Login Page

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)**
* **Justification:** A classic, unauthenticated SQL injection that leads directly to an authentication bypass. This is the entry point for the entire attack chain, resulting in a full system compromise, hence the high impact scores.

### 2. Unrestricted File Upload

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **8.8 (High)**
* **Justification:** This requires low-privileged access (a logged-in user), but the exploit is simple and provides direct command execution on the server as the `www-data` user, leading to high impact.

### 3. Privilege Escalation via Writable Cron Job

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **7.8 (High)**
* **Justification:** A local attack requiring an existing shell. The exploit is trivial (overwrite a file and wait), and success results in a full `root` compromise.
