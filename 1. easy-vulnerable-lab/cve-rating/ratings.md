## Easy Lab - Vulnerability Risk Ratings

This document provides a CVSS v3.1 risk rating for the vulnerabilities in this lab.

### 1. Anonymous FTP & Information Disclosure

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/C:L/I:N/A:N`
* **Base Score:** **5.3 (Medium)**
* **Justification:** This vulnerability is network-exploitable with no complexity or privileges required. It results in a low confidentiality impact by disclosing a username and wordlist, but has no integrity or availability impact on its own.

### 2. SSH Brute-Force via Disclosed Credentials

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **9.8 (Critical)**
* **Justification:** Although this is a brute-force, the attack complexity is low because a valid username and a very small, targeted wordlist are provided. A successful attack provides direct shell access, resulting in a complete compromise of the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### 3. Privilege Escalation via SUID Misconfiguration

* **CVSS Vector:** `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/C:H/I:H/A:H`
* **Base Score:** **7.8 (High)**
* **Justification:** This is a local attack that requires an existing low-privileged shell. The exploit is simple and well-documented. Success results in a full `root` compromise, leading to a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
